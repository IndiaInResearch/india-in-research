# India In Research

[indiainresearch.org](https://indiainresearch.org/) is an initiative which aims to covers cover stories and insights about Indian research and academia. We scrape and then illustrate the analysis in a manner that can be readily understood by (perhaps) a school student.

In the longer context, this aims to become a transparent [GOTO](https://gotorankings.org/) ranking system, subtly different from alternatives like NIRF. The closest alternative project to this is the very popular [csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org/).

Right now, we have included several of the most popular conferences in computer science including NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, STOC, FOCS, ACL, MobiCom etc. 

## Data Sources

We are currently using multiple data source including, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [dblp](https://dblp.org/), [Paper Copilot](https://github.com/papercopilot), [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/).

Our data for raw analysis is available here: [paper-data](https://github.com/IndiaInResearch/paper-data).

Note: Some data has been analyzed by AI and may be incorrect.
